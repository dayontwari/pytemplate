Requirements:
    - python >=2.6.6
      On Debian: $ aptitude install python
      OR         $ aptitude install python2.6

Installation:
    1. Copy pytemplate to /usr/local/bin and make sure permissions
        are set to rwxr-xr-x ($ chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pytemplate)
Usage:
    Run `pytemplate -h` for a list of options.

    If you're running pytemplate for the first time, you need to setup
    the configuration file by running `pytemplate -c` and providing the
    values at the prompt. For now pytemplate will save the config file
    as ~/.pytemplate.conf in your home directory.

    To create a python file run `pytemplate`.

    To also have pytemplate create a git repo for the python file being
    created, run `pytemplate -g`.

Feedback:
    Any type of helpful feedback is always welcome. You email me
    at jargonsummary@gmail.com. I'm also on IRC in the
    Python channel on freenode. My nick is jargon.

Credits:
    A big thank you to all the patient help and education I get
    from all the wonderful people on IRC in #python and on the Python
    Tutor mailing list (tutor@python.org). Most of what I know
    about Python I've learned from them.
